<h1 id="mainheader">WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT</h1>
”It’s like five-dimesional chess against the world” - Mark Cuban
<br/><br/><br/>
<p>
League of Legends, as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena">MOBA</a>, is a game bit like chess. But instead of playing solo the player, as a
member of team of five, competes against other. As in chess, the board / map is basically always the same.
However, the variation of pieces in League of Legends is significantly bigger – 134 different at the moment
and new ones are released constantly.
</p>
<p>
In LoL there is the blue and the red team. Game is over once other team manages to infiltrate other team’s
base in the other opposite corner of the map or if other team surrenders. One game takes 40 minutes on
average. The winner is mostly decided by which team works better as a unit.
</p>
<p>
Alongside computer game League of Legeds is also an e-sport in which players compete
professionally. In the end of each season new official world champion is crowned and one team hoists the
hard-earned summoner’s cup. The culture as a whole is today a huge business and as an e-sport, the market
of future.

<h2 id="Beginning">THE BEGINNING</h2>
<p>
At 90’s the internet had become commodity which brought casual gamers together. Until this computer and console games had been mostly for individuals or shared by friends but now
it was suddenly possible to chain many computers and play games with multiple players. This was the first step on way to global gaming and playing with total starngers / anybody.
</p>
<p>
The ancestor of MOBA genre is real-time strategy. In these games player would build a base which enabled production and commanding of small armies used for defeating enemy’s
equivalent. Well known first examples are Dune and Command&Conquer games.
</p>
<p>
<h3>WARCRAFT 3</h3>
<p>
Warcraft, by Blizzard, was as well real-time strategy in the
ancient fantasy world of orcs and humans. The third part
of the series was the first of it’s kind by introducing the consept
of unique champions as leaders of the armies. They were the
strongest units in game and at least as important as the rest
of armies themselves.
</p>
<h3>MODING & DOTA</h3>
<p>
In many games, as well as in Warcraft 3, there had been community-based modes of games for which gamers
themselves customized differents setups and rules. Among community a mod called Defender of the
Ancients (DotA) gathered(?) fast a lot of attention and dedication and in the end grew almost as popular
as Warcraft 3 itself. In it players control only the champion as a team of five.
</p>
<h3>RIOT OF GAMES</h3>
<p>
Riot Games was founded in 2006. The small company consisted of gaming enthusiasts of which some
had been previously working for Blizzard. League of Legends, closely based on DotA, was officially released
late 2009 in north america and europe got it’s own server soon afterwards. Despite of moderately bad visuals
it managed to hook people being fun. At the time of release there was total of 42 champions. Season 1
started at 2010.
</p>
<h3>DREAMHACK 2011</h3>
<p>
At the time culture of competitive gaming was based on big collective and commercial LAN parties all around
the world. Huge group of people related to gaming or the industry gathered under the same roof to share the
same passion. During these the unofficial championships of many different games were dicided.
</p>
<p>
League of Legends’ first final tournament of season was staged(?) at Dreamhack 2011 in Jönköping
Sweden. It was still relatively unknown game and the competition consisted only of north american and
european amateur teams.
</p>
<p>
It was clash of two different playstyles and the most succesful one has prevailed so basically until today.
On the contrary of what was anticipated by most there was two european teams in the finals in which Fnatic
took the victory over AgainstAllAuthority. The event was really small-scale and maybe not more than hundred
people were fitnessing the finals on spot.
</p>
</div>
<div class="white_back">
<h2 id="What we know">WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR</h2>
<p>
Riot had decided to invest into esports. Even though the time was too young for bigger markets it started the era of professional global competition. Season 2 was about to end with
world championships. Suddenly there was a lot more organisations and also Asia, as anticipated joined in.
</p>
<h3>SEASON 2 - THE GAME EVOLVES</h3>
<p>
The general strategy was set and it started to evolve getting more diverse. Small over-continental rivalries began to build and the foundations for culture had been laid.
</p>
<p>
There was yet no organized competition structure and the time before worlds was about LAN-parties. Outside of the best of Dreamhack russian team Moscow5 ended up dominating
the season.
They emerged from somewhere and suddenly it seemed there wasn’t any serious contenders. Their oppressive strategies took long time from others to figure how to counter and nowadays
the game is played as they innovated.
</p>
<p>
Most probably thought M5 was about to storm the World Championships although asian teams, koreans in front had started to show serious improvement. However their journey ended
at semifinals by Taipei Assassins who showerd their own version of the game instead. This led eventually to finals and victory over korean Azubu Frost and of tournament, million dollars
and the summoner’s cup.
</p>
<h3>KOREA</h3>
<p>
The birthplace of esports is South Korea / Seoul. It’s firstborn Starcaft: Broodwar grew to
be enough popular the first real stardoms popping up as well. This all lasted years and
is still today somehow alive. The reasons for it’s decay are complex but after it League
of Legends was to be the new big thing. Their history and experience of competitive
gaming was about to show.
</p>
<h3>SEASON 3 - THE PRODIGY</h3>
<p>
The year launched the official leagues of pro gaming on many different regions. During
the year all eyes were already on Korea but on last half new team of rising rookies SKT
T1, led by prodigy known as Faker broke into local scene ending up winning it.
</p>
<p>
At the time of world championships asian teams were previewed(?) top seeded. Only
this time China had arosed to be a serious powerhouse and contender of Korea and in
the finals there were one team from both. Eventually chinese Royal Club, led by their
brightest star Uzi got dismantled 3-0 by Fakers squad.
</p>
<h3>SEASONS 4-6 - THE REIGN</h3>
<p>
Due to overwhelming performance other regions start their chase by studying the
differences. Soon it becomes clear that it’s not only about the game itself but also all
the other things around it including already existing infrastructure and own national
association for esports. Their training was professional as well having own coaches
and analysts which was unheard for others.
</p>
<p>
Season 4 had it’s final tournament held finally in Korea / Seoul and first time out of US.
It was rough year for SKT T1 failing to participate Worlds at all and at the time of it all
were talking about ”the perfect team” – Samsung White. The final itself almost filled
Seoul olympic stadium with 40,000 people witnessing the spectacle in which the replay
of previous year took place. This time Uzi with Star Horn Royal Club had to admit korean
SSW better by 3-1. The gap was closing. :)
</p>
<p>
Next offseason started by ”korean exodus” - players were purchased from korea as
imports stacking all the other regions, especially China. For them it was going to be
a great year them having now all the best talent. Except Faker. The season 5 final
tournament took place in Europe. China failed miserably but this time european teams
hold their ground placing two teams in semis against korean counterparts but in the
end the final was between latter. SKT T1 beat KOO Tigers 3-1 being the first team and
having first players (Faker and Bengi) to win twice. Fully korean finals told something
else about the gap.
</p>
<p>
6th season was about ”EUxodus” them moving especially to NA. Also the time was ripe
for big markets and venture capitalists to jump in the scene.
</p>
<p>
In official international mid year event (MSI) Europe plummeted though NA showed
surprisingly strong but int the end was overcome by koreans. Despite the result happening
showed promising rest of the year for others.
</p>
<p>
This was the first year the reigning champions managed to participate on next year’s
championships bringing SKT T1 back to US. It was supposed to be the tightest tournament
for years and it started well by even wild card teams winning some games. What
happened though was that three out of 4 teams in semis were koreans one euroapean
team as their brake. Fully korean finals showed the gap was there and about to stay by
SKT T1, Faker and Bengi taking their third titles against Samsung Galaxy. The reign
continues...
